# Python learning

As part of my python learning journey I am hosting the code base on this repo. Please feel free to contrinute or provide comments on the codebase 


## Setup

I am using [Pipenv](https://pipenv.pypa.io/en/latest/) to setup a virual enviroment to segregate dependenices from other python projects I work on localy. The virtual environment is hosted within the project folder. Please set **PIPENV_VENV_IN_PROJECT** environment variable to 1 prior to launching pipenv shell command. 

For linting and code formating I am using [Pylint](https://pylint.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) & [Yapf](https://github.com/google/yapf) respectively

### bash
`
  export PIPENV_VENV_IN_PROJECT=1
`
### Windows Powershell
`
  $env:PIPENV_VENV_IN_PROJECT=1
`

I am currently engaged in several Python projects to enhance my proficiency in the language. The list of projects I am actively working on is as follows

1. [inclusive hello world](hello_world)
2. [file splitter](file_splitter)
